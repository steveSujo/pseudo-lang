# Pseudo lang

===========================================================

I've been tinkering with the idea of creating a programming language for a while now, and Pseudo is the result of that exploration. It's not a finished product, and it's not intended to be a production-ready language. It's simply a collection of code that represents my attempt to understand the inner workings of programming languages.

# What is Pseudo?

Pseudo is an experimental programming language that I've been working on in my spare time. It's a way for me to learn about the concepts and techniques that underlie the design and implementation of programming languages. I'm not trying to create something that will change the world; I'm just trying to learn.

# Getting Started 

## Build from source 

### Requirements

* Rustc
* Cargo
  
clone this repo and cd into it then

```shell
# run with cargo
cargo run 
```

# Current State

The project is still in its early stages, and there's a lot of work to be done. The current roadmap includes:

- [ ] Lexical analysis
- [ ] Parsing the Tokens
- [ ] Static analysis
- [ ] Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)

I'll get to these eventually, but no promises on when.

<!-- # Documentation -->

<!-- There's some documentation in the Docs directory, but it's not comprehensive. I'll try to keep it up-to-date as the project evolves. -->
<!-- Why Bother? -->

<!-- I'm not really sure. I just find this stuff interesting, and I wanted to see if I could do it. If you're interested in looking at the code, be my guest. Just don't expect it to be perfect; it's a work in progress. -->
